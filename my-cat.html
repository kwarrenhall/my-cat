    <h1>Owning a Snow Lepord</h1>
    <h2>or how to keep a wild animal in the home...</h2>

    <p>I don't know how it happened but one day a snow lepord followed me home.  For those who are unfamiliar with snow leapords, or think they may have had the same expeirence, here are a few ways to identify a snow lepord:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A snow lepord is white</li>
      <li>A snow lepord is medium sized</li>
      <li>A snow lepord usually lives in snowy regions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>these are pictures of my past cats:</p>
